The plugin watches packages for INSTALL, DEINSTALL and UPGRADE events and
executes a set of scripts after 'pkg install', 'pkg upgrade', 'pkg remove' or
'pkg autoremove' have been run.

Create /usr/local/etc/pkg/watchpkg.conf based on watchpkg.conf.sample and edit
it to your liking.

In /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf, make sure PKG_ENABLE_PLUGINS is set to true and
add "watchpkg" to PLUGINS.

Check your setup via 'pkg plugins':

  $ pkg plugins
  NAME       DESC                                          VERSION
  watchpkg   Watch for package changes                     1.0.0
